# NFA to DFA Conversion Algorithm

The following algorithm outlines the process of converting a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) to a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA).

## Function: `convertNFAtoDFA(NFA)`

1. **Initialization:**
    - Initialize `DFAStates` with the epsilon closure of the NFA's initial state.

2. **Main Loop:**
    - While there are unmarked DFA states:
        - Mark a DFA state.
        - For each symbol in the alphabet:
            - Find the set of NFA states reachable from the current DFA state using the symbol.
            - Take the epsilon closure of the union of NFA states reached.
            - If the new set is not in `DFAStates`, create a new DFA state.
            - Create a transition from the current DFA state to the new DFA state labeled with the symbol.

3. **Accepting States:**
    - Mark DFA states as accepting if they contain at least one NFA accepting state.

4. **Optional: Minimize DFA**
    - Call the `minimizeDFA()` function to implement a state minimization algorithm if desired.

## Function: `minimizeDFA()`

Implement a state minimization algorithm if desired. This step is optional and can be used to reduce the number of states in the DFA.
