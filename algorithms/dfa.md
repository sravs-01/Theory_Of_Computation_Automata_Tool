### DFA Construction Algorithm for a Given Language:

## **Input:**
   - Alphabet Σ
   - Language L over Σ

## **DFA Construction Steps**:

1. **Initialize:**
   - Create an empty set of states for the DFA: DQ=∅.
   - Initialize the DFA transition table as an empty table.

2. **Create States:**
   - For each subset S of Σ, create a corresponding state in DQ.

3. **Define Transitions:**
   - For each state DQ~i in DQ and each symbol a in Σ:
     - Define the transition DQ~i (a)-> where DQ~j is the state representing the set of symbols that can follow a in the language.

4. **DFA Accepting States:**
   - Determine the accepting states based on the subsets that represent words in the language.

5. **Output:**
   - The DFA is represented by the set of states DQ, alphabet Σ, transition table, start state (usually the state corresponding to the empty set), and set of accepting states.

### Example:
Suppose Σ={0,1} and the language L consists of all strings with an even number of 1s. The DFA might have states corresponding to subsets such as {even}, {odd}, etc., where "even" and "odd" represent the parity of the number of 1s.

### Notes:
- The states in DQ directly represent subsets of Σ or conditions based on the language.
- The transition table is defined based on the language's rules.
